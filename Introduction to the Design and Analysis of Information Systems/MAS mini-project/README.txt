Mini Projects â€“ Conceptual & Relational Model Implementation
This repository contains five mini-projects (MP1 â€“ MP5) developed as part of the Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Information Systems. Each project focuses on implementing key constructs from the conceptual model while integrating with the relational model. These projects serve as foundational work for the final project, where additional features like a GUI will be added.

Project Overview
Each mini-project (MPx) adheres to specific requirements outlined by the course, focusing on different aspects of conceptual and relational modeling. The scope of assessed items includes:

MP1 â€“ Classes & Attributes
Implementation of classes and attributes
Extent & Extent persistency
Complex, optional, multi-valued, derived, and class attributes
Class methods, method overriding & overloading
MP2 â€“ Associations
Implementation of associations (with extent & persistency)
Support for complex, optional, multi-valued, derived, and class attributes
Class methods, method overriding & overloading
MP3 â€“ Inheritance & Polymorphism
Disjoint, overlapping, and multiple inheritance
Abstract classes & dynamic method calls
Multi-aspect inheritance
MP4 â€“ Constraints
Attribute constraints: unique, subset, ordered, bag, XOR, custom constraints
MP5 â€“ Database & ORM Integration
Classes, associations, and inheritance in the relational model
Implementation of 1: and : cardinalities*
Development of a working program using a database
Support for ORM tools like Hibernate or Entity Framework
Implementation Details
Each project is implemented as a simple console application.
Source code contains comments explaining key constructs and implementation steps.
Main.java (or equivalent) file includes examples demonstrating how each construct works.
No binary files or external dependencies are included in the repository.

How to Run the Projects?
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

Navigate to the respective mini-project folder.
Compile and run the project based on the chosen programming language.
Notes
Each project is self-contained and does not mix examples from different assessments.
The final project will build upon these implementations with additional features.
